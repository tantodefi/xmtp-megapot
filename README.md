```

## Usage

The agent uses event-driven message handling with XMTP's Agent-SDK and streams messages in real-time. Send messages to the agent at its XMTP inbox address.

### Transaction Flow

The agent uses a secure transaction delegation model:

1. **User Request**: Send "buy X tickets" to the agent
2. **Transaction Preparation**: Agent prepares USDC approval + ticket purchase transactions
3. **User Execution**: User sees inline buttons and executes transactions in their wallet
4. **Confirmation**: Agent confirms successful transaction execution

### Available Commands

The agent responds to natural language commands:

- **"ping"** - Test response ("ok")
- **"buy 5 tickets"** - Purchase lottery tickets (shows inline transaction buttons)
- **"my stats"** - View your lottery statistics
- **"jackpot info"** - Current jackpot information
- **"claim winnings"** - Claim lottery winnings
- **"gm" or "hello"** - Welcome message with mini app link
- **"help"** - Show available commands

### Inline Transaction Buttons

When purchasing tickets, users see interactive buttons in XMTP chat:

```
üé´ Ready to purchase 5 MegaPot tickets!
üí∞ Ticket Price: 1.00 USDC each
üí∞ Total Cost: 5.00 USDC

[Approve USDC] [Purchase Tickets]
```

These buttons use the `WalletSendCalls` content type to securely send transaction data to the user's wallet for execution.

### Event-Driven Features

- **Real-time Streaming**: Uses `client.conversations.streamAllMessages()` for live message processing
- **Money Bag Reactions**: Automatically reacts with üí∞ to ALL messages
- **Smart Command Detection**: Recognizes commands through natural language processing
- **Secure Transactions**: Users execute transactions directly from their wallets
- **Content Type Support**: Proper `WalletSendCalls` codec for transaction proposals
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Message Filtering**: Filters out self-messages and non-text content

## Mini App Integration

The agent includes integration with the MegaPot Mini App at https://megapot.io for enhanced features:

- Real-time jackpot updates
- Advanced lottery analytics
- Enhanced purchasing experience
- Social features and leaderboards

### Mini App Link Sharing

The agent sends the mini app URL as a separate message to ensure proper metadata rendering in XMTP chat clients.

## Referrer System

The agent supports MegaPot's referrer system through the `MEGAPOT_REFERRER_ADDRESS` environment variable. When users purchase tickets through the agent, the referrer address is included in the transaction, allowing for proper fee distribution.

- **Text**: Standard text messages

### Transaction Flow Architecture

```
User Message ‚Üí Agent Processing ‚Üí Transaction Preparation ‚Üí WalletSendCalls ‚Üí User Approval ‚Üí Transaction Execution
```

### Security Model

- **No Agent Wallet Execution**: Agent never executes transactions on behalf of users
- **Transaction Delegation**: Users sign and execute all transactions themselves
- **Secure Content Types**: Uses XMTP's secure content type system
- **User Address Resolution**: Agent resolves user addresses from XMTP inbox IDs

## Error Handling

The agent includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network failures and RPC timeouts
- Contract interaction errors (getCurrentDraw, ticketPrice)
- Insufficient funds (handled at wallet level)
- Transaction preparation failures
- XMTP content type encoding errors
- User address resolution failures
- API timeouts and authentication issues

### Transaction-Specific Error Handling

- **Contract Reverts**: Graceful fallback from `getCurrentDraw()` to `ticketPrice()`
- **User Wallet Errors**: Clear messaging when wallet interactions fail
- **Transaction Preparation**: Validation of ticket counts and amounts
- **Network Issues**: Automatic retry logic for transient failures

### User-Friendly Error Messages

All errors are presented with actionable guidance:
```
‚ùå Failed to prepare purchase: Contract interaction failed. Please try again later.
```

## Deployment

The agent is designed to run continuously and can be deployed to services like Railway, Render, or any Node.js hosting platform.
