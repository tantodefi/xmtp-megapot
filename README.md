### ü§ñ Smart Conversation Examples

**Natural Ticket Purchasing:**
- "I want to buy 5 lottery tickets"
- "Can I purchase ten tickets please?"
- "Buy me some lottery tickets" ‚Üí Agent asks how many

**Information Requests:**
- "What's the current jackpot?"

### Transaction Flow

The agent uses a secure transaction delegation model:

1. **User Request**: Send "buy X tickets" to the agent
2. **Transaction Preparation**: Agent prepares USDC approval + ticket purchase transactions
3. **User Execution**: User sees inline buttons and executes transactions in their wallet
4. **Confirmation**: Agent confirms successful transaction execution

### Available Commands

The agent responds to natural language commands:

- **"ping"** - Test response ("ok")
- **"buy 5 tickets"** - Purchase lottery tickets (shows inline transaction buttons)
- **"my stats"** - View your lottery statistics
- **"jackpot info"** - Current jackpot information
- **"claim winnings"** - Claim lottery winnings
- **"gm" or "hello"** - Welcome message with mini app link
- **"help"** - Show available commands

### Inline Transaction Buttons

When purchasing tickets, users see interactive buttons in XMTP chat:

```
üé´ Ready to purchase 5 MegaPot tickets!
üí∞ Ticket Price: 1.00 USDC each
üí∞ Total Cost: 5.00 USDC

[Approve USDC] [Purchase Tickets]
```

These buttons use the `WalletSendCalls` content type to securely send transaction data to the user's wallet for execution.

- **Money Bag Reactions**: Automatically reacts with üí∞ to ALL messages
